##Project Overview
Our project is to code a location recommender for individuals looking to find the perfect location to settle down in or at the very least move to. We will examine multiple different data points for the Top 25 most populous cities in the United States. The data points being taken into account are Rent and Housing prices, the average cost of living in each city, the Crime Statistics to measure overall safety, and a Lifestyle index to help people select a location based on their interests and hobbies, and there will be an income input section to help the user to make sure that they are not living in a location that they cannot afford.

##Data Collected
You can find the data sets that we are working with in our Data folder within the repository

##How to complete the project
The primary step is to collect the data and clean it to make it usable for the project and readable for the users. Once this step has been finished, we will to divide the cities into different income brackets. This way we can match the user with a city that will be affordable and still offer the same benefits as other cities. The next step will be to design the decision making matrix so that we are able to best match the user with their city. More details on the details of this matrix are to come.
