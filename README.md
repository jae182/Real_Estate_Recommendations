## Project Overview
Our project is to perform real estate analysis for the Top 25 Most Populous Cities in the United States for individuals looking to find the perfect location to  move to. The data points being taken into account are Rent and Housing prices, the average cost of living in each city, the Crime Statistics to measure overall safety, and a Lifestyle index to help people select a location based on their interests and hobbies. Through analyzing these data points, we will be able to take a look under the hood of the cities in question and see what they have to offer.

## Data Collected
You can find the data sets that we are working with in our Data folders within the repository.

## Questions to Answer through Analysis
We hope to be able to answer some questions about what these cities have to offer to potential residents and give them the best possible information before deciding where to move. Here are a list of questions we hope to help potential movers answer:
1. What are the safest cities to be in?
2. What do each of the cities have to offer in terms of hobbies and interests?
3. Where is the best location to move if you're looking to start a family?
4. Which cities are the most and least expensive?
5. What is the best place for me?

## Results From Analysis
After going through very basic analysis of the housing/rent prices in the cities, we were able to answer a few of the questions that new movers may face when relocating. We were able to provide graphs showing the safest cities, along with cities with the highest crime rates in the nation. We also provide housing prices for unit sizes up to a 4 unit household. We are able to show the most expensive cities based on not only housing prices but also taking into account the cost of living. 

## Answers to Questions
1. From our interpretation of the Crime Index, we found that the safest cities are Jacksonville, El Paso, and Boston. 
2. In terms of hobbies and interests a lot of cities offer a wide variety of options when it comes to an individual's interest and hobbies. Unfortunately, we were unable to use our data set in a way that provided an insight into what each city specifically had to offer.
3. Based on the housing data, crime rate, and lifestyle indexes that revolve around raising a family, we found that 
4. Taking into account the housing prices and the cost of living, we found that San Jose, San Francisco, and New York City are the most expensive cities. On the flip side, for individuals looking to save money and find an affordable area to live in, we found that El Paso, Oklahoma City, and Indianapolis are the best cities to live in.
5. In the end, determining what the best place for an individual is a highly opinionated decision. There are many factors that should be taken into account but we provided enough analysis that an individual should be able to have the ability to, at the very least eliminate some options from their decision making process.
