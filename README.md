## Project Overview
Our project is to perform real estate analysis for the Top 25 Most Populous Cities in the United States for individuals looking to find the perfect location to  move to. The data points being taken into account are Rent and Housing prices, the average cost of living in each city, the Crime Statistics to measure overall safety, and a Lifestyle index to help people select a location based on their interests and hobbies. Through analyzing these data points, we will be able to take a look under the hood of the cities in question and see what they have to offer.

## Data Collected
You can find the data sets that we are working with in our Data folders within the repository.

## Questions to Answer through Analysis
We hope to be able to answer some questions about what these cities have to offer to potential residents and give them the best possible information before deciding where to move. Here are a list of questions we hope to help potential movers answer:
1. What are the safest cities to be in?
2. What do each of the cities have to offer in terms of hobbies and interests?
3. Where is the best location to move if you're looking to start a family?
4. Which cities are the most and least expensive?
5. What is the best place for me?
